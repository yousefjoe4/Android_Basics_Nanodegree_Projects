# Android_Basics_Nanodegree_Projects
Some of the projects that I created from scratch while studying Android basics through Udacity.


Topics covered in the Nanodegree program:

User Interface - You will learn how to build nice screens, layouts according to standards, so your apps will look good
User Input - You will learn how to make your apps interactive.
MultiScreen Apps - The more screen you have, the more possibilities you discover. You will learn about switching among different screens, activities and fragments.
Networking - There are a huge amount of available API-s all over the internet, with the help of them you can build apps with dynamic content. You will learn about HTTP requests, JSON Parsing and threads.
Data Storage - Now you have the data, you need to store them somewhere, right? You'll learn about storing data with the help of SQLite.
